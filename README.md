Kestrel brings focused browsing, flexible split panes and a configurable assistant together in a Mac-first app.

## Features

- Independent browser panes with their own address bars and navigation.
- Custom keyboard shortcuts, tab groups and pinned pages.
- An assistant with optional web search and page context. Choose a provider in Settings.
- Local browser preferences and WebKit website storage.
- Built-in update checks, with **Kestrel → Check for Updates…** for a manual check.

Kestrel uses Apple's WebKit engine. Chromium extensions are not fully supported. Assistant page text may be sent to the selected provider when you use the assistant; review the provider and privacy controls in Settings.

## Install

Download `Kestrel-Browser.zip`, open it, then move `Kestrel.app` to Applications. This first release is ad-hoc signed and is not notarized; macOS may show a Gatekeeper warning when you first open it. We will label signing and notarization status for each release.

## Source code

Source code is private for now. I plan to attach it only after cleaning up the code and verifying that identifying marks have been removed. For now, this repository contains prebuilt releases, screenshots and release notes only.
